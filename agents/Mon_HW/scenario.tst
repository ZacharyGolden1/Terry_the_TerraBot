Test 1:
Description: The first test involves comparing the reading from the new temperature 
sensor to the readings from the existing temperature sensors in the greenhouse. 
This test will calculate the temperature difference between the new sensor and 
the average of the existing sensors over a certain time period.

Steps:

Collect temperature data from the new sensor and the existing sensors (A, B, C) 
for the past hour, with readings taken every 5 minutes.
Calculate the average temperature from sensors A, B, and C.
Calculate the temperature difference between the new sensor's reading and the 
average temperature from step 2.
Set a threshold for an acceptable temperature difference.
If the temperature difference exceeds the threshold, trigger an alert indicating 
a potential issue with the new sensor's accuracy.
What the test indicates is wrong:
If the test indicates a significant temperature difference between the new sensor 
and the existing ones, it suggests that the new sensor may be malfunctioning or 
incorrectly calibrated.

Recovery potential:
To recover from this issue, you can recalibrate or replace the new temperature 
sensor and ensure that it is reading temperatures accurately.

Test 2:
Description: The second test involves cross-referencing the temperature reading 
from the new sensor with other environmental data such as humidity, and light levels 
within the greenhouse. This test aims to identify any anomalies or 
correlations between the high temperature reading and other environmental factors.

Steps:

Collect data from the new temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and light sensor.
Analyze the data for any patterns or correlations.
Set thresholds for acceptable environmental conditions 
If the high temperature reading from the new sensor coincides with unfavorable 
conditions in other parameters, trigger an alert.
What the test indicates is wrong:
If the test identifies a correlation between the high temperature reading and 
adverse environmental conditions, it may indicate a malfunction in the new 
temperature sensor or an issue affecting the overall greenhouse environment.

Recovery potential:
To recover from this issue, you can investigate and address the environmental 
factors causing the temperature spike, such as ventilation, or light level. If 
the new sensor is consistently reading high, consider 
recalibration or replacement.

Preferred Test: Test 2
Reasons for Preference:

Test 2 considers a broader range of environmental data, providing a more holistic 
view of the greenhouse conditions, making it more likely to identify the root cause 
of the issue.
It can help differentiate between sensor malfunction and actual environmental 
issues by cross-referencing with other parameters.
Pros and Cons of Test 2 compared to Test 1:

Pros:
Test 2 provides a more comprehensive analysis of the situation by considering 
multiple environmental factors.
It allows for a more accurate diagnosis by identifying correlations between the 
high temperature reading and other conditions.
Cons:
Test 2 may require additional computational resources and data collection compared 
to Test 1.
It may be more complex to implement due to the need for concurrent data analysis.
